             <p>The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world. Blue whales are able to breathe air, but they are very comfortable in the ocean waters where buoyancy helps to support their incredible bulk. These mammals are found in all the world's oceans and often swim in small groups or alone. A blue whale calf weighs two tons (1,814 kilograms) at birth and gains an extra 200 pounds (91 kilograms) each day of its first year. These giant creatures feed on tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Each fluke (tail fin) is unique, like a human fingerprint, scientists use flukes to monitor the habits and migrations of individual whales. A blue whale's heart is the size of a small car!</p>
             <p>Its sheer mass is almost inconceivable, with adults averaging 30 metres long and weighing 200 tons. In terms of its size relative to other mammals, some scientists believe it may even be larger than the dinosaurs that once roamed our planet.</p>
             <blockquote>
                "The blue whales tongue weighs as much as an elephant" - <cite> The National Geographic </cite>
             </blockquote>
             <p>The blue whale is an endangered species due to a combination of factors, including hunting, climate change, and ocean pollution. Only a few thousand blue whales are believed to swim the world's oceans. They were hunted for many years for their blubber and oil, and they were almost hunted to extinction. They were protected under the 1966 International Whaling Convention. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the species, but it is still at risk of extinction. Despite this, the blue whale remains an awe-inspiring creature, and its sheer size and power are a reminder of the beauty of nature.</p>

         <h2>Giraffe- The Tallest Land Animal</h2>
         <h3>Read time: 4 minutes</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Giraffes are considered to be the tallest living land animal on planet earth and have an average height of 4.7 metres. The long necks of Giraffes allow them to reach high levels of vegetation that other animals cannot access. They can lick their eyes amd ears because their tongues are so long - about 40-50cm long. Their legs are about 6ft long and their kick is so poweful it can crack a lion's skull! Giraffes can be found in savannah habitats in sub-saharan Africa. Recent scientific studies suggest that the giraffe spot patterns might be inherited from their parents. The pattern is like the human fingerprint - each one unique. Researchers use a Giraffes pattern to identify individuals during surveys. The Giraffes pattern also serves as a camoflage. Each patch in the patterm acts as a thermal window to release body heat through a very sophisticated system of blood vessels.</p>
<blockquote>
    "I love Giraffes!" - <cite> Rose, 2024 </cite>
 </blockquote>
<p>Many young giraffes, called calves, die from lion attacks during their first year of life. Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often enough to protect it from lions. Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending down to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in shifts so that at least one giraffe is always on the lookout for approaching predators.​ </p>
<p>The giraffes' height and excellent vision give them a wide view of the grasslands where they live, making it easy to spot predators from a distance. Some scientists believe that other animals—such as zebras, antelope, and wildebeests—often congregate near giraffes to take advantage of their ability to see danger from a distance. The giraffe could be considered the early warning system of the African grasslands.</p>

         <h2>Giant African Elephant - The Heaviest Land Animal</h2>
         <h3>Read time: 7 minutes</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>The African elephant is widely considered to be the largest land animal in the world. It is certainly in the running for being the heaviest land animal as well. They are particularly well-known for their long trunks and prominent tusks, which can grow up to 3 metres long. Adult males can weigh up to 6 tons and stand up to 4 metres tall; females can reach 4.5 metres tall and weigh about 5.4 tons.<p> 

</p>An adult African elephant's trunk is about seven feet (two meters) long! It's actually an elongated nose and upper lip. Like most noses, trunks are for smelling. When an elephant drinks, it sucks as much as 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of water into its trunk at a time. Then it curls its trunk under, sticks the tip of its trunk into its mouth, and blows. Out comes the water, right down the elephant's throat. When an elephant drinks, it sucks as much as 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of water into its trunk at a time. Then it curls its trunk under, sticks the tip of its trunk into its mouth, and blows. Out comes the water, right down the elephant's throat. Since African elephants live where the sun is usually blazing hot, they use their trunks to help them keep cool. First they squirt a trunkful of cool water over their bodies. Then they often follow that with a sprinkling of dust to create a protective layer of dirt on their skin. Elephants pick up and spray dust the same way they do water—with their trunks.</p>
<p>Elephants also use their trunks as snorkels when they wade in deep water. An elephant's trunk is controlled by many muscles. Two fingerlike parts on the tip of the trunk allow the elephant to perform delicate maneuvers such as picking a berry from the ground or plucking a single leaf off a tree. Elephants can also use its trunk to grasp an entire tree branch and pull it down to its mouth and to yank up clumps of grasses and shove the greenery into their mouths.</p>
<p>When an elephant gets a whiff of something interesting, it sniffs the air with its trunk raised up like a submarine periscope. If threatened, an elephant will also use its trunk to make loud trumpeting noises as a warning.Elephants are social creatures. They sometimes hug by wrapping their trunks together in displays of greeting and affection. Elephants also use their trunks to help lift or nudge an elephant calf over an obstacle, to rescue a fellow elephant stuck in mud, or to gently raise a newborn elephant to its feet. And just as a human baby sucks its thumb, an elephant calf often sucks its trunk for comfort. One elephant can eat 300 pounds (136 kilograms) of food in one day. They are also highly intelligent, with the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror and to use tools. </p>
<p>African elephants are an endangered species, with their population declining due to poaching and habitat loss. People hunt elephants mainly for their ivory tusks. Adult females and young travel in herds, while adult males generally travel alone or in groups of their own.</p>

         <h2>Saltwater Crocodile - The Largest Reptile</h2>
         <h3>Read time: 4 minutes</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Saltwater Crocodiles are widely considered to be the largest reptiles on earth. Adult males typically measure between 5-6 metres long, but some specimens can grow even larger. Saltwater crocodiles possess a reputation for being aggressive predators and are responsible for numerous attacks on humans and other animals throughout Asia and Australia. Although Nile crocodiles resemble armored tanks with huge, teeth-filled mouths, these reptiles are unusually attentive parents.</p>
<p>When a large male Nile crocodile spots a female that catches his eye, he bellows and splashes, slapping his snout on the water to get her attention. He grunts and growls, and sometimes, inhales as hard as he can, submerging his snout and blowing water through his nostrils, producing a fountainlike spray. The female croc is ready to lay her eggs nearly two months after mating. She scouts the area for a suitable nest site in which to lay the eggs, usually digging a hole on a riverbank, shoreline, or dry streambed. She deposits from 25 to 80 eggs in the nest, then settles in for a long vigil. For a reptile, it's an unusual display of devotion. Other reptiles lay their eggs, then move on. The female croc, however, will keep constant guard over the nest during the three-month incubation period, leaving only to cool off in a nearby shady spot or for a quick dip in the water. The male is usually close by to help scare off predators.</p>
<p>Just before hatching, the young crocs send out high-pitched sounds—a signal for help. The female digs up the nest. The mother croc then carefully picks up the 12-inch-long (30.5-centimeter-long) hatchlings in her mouth and carries them to the water. The young crocs live under their mother's protection for up to two years, feeding on insects and small fish and growing about a foot (about 30 centimeters) each year.</p>

         <h2>Ostrich - The Heaviest Bird</h2>
         <h3>Read time: 5 minutes</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>The ostrich is the tallest and the heaviest of all birds. While the huge ostrich is a bird, it does not fly. Instead it runs. An ostrich stands up to 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall. That's much taller than the average man. In one stride, an ostrich can cover up to 16 feet (4.9 meters)—about the length of a mid-size family car! The bird is speedy, too. It can run just over 40 miles (64 kilometers) an hour for a short distance, and can keep up a speed of more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) an hour over longer distances. The ostrich uses its short wings for balance, holding them outstretched when it runs. Strong legs can also be used for self-defense. An ostrich will kick with a force mighty enough to kill a lion.</p>
<blockquote>
"Ostriches can reach speeds of over 70km per hour" - <cite> Catherine D. Hughes, The National Geographic. </cite>
</blockquote>
<p> When danger approaches, an ostrich will often lie low to hide, stretching its neck along the ground. Its feather colors blend with the sandy soil where it lives. From far away, it looks like the ostrich has buried its head in the sand. Many people thought that was what ostriches did when they were trying to hide, but that is a myth. Ostriches live near grazing animals such as wildebeest, antelopes, and zebras. The grazers stir up insects and rodents for the ostriches to eat, and the ostriches warn the grazers to dangers such as approaching lions.</p>
<p>An ostrich group, called a herd, numbers about 12 individuals. Male ostriches compete for control of a group of several females. A herd has a dominant male and a dominant female. She mates only with him, though he may mate with other females as well. All the egg-laying females, called hens, lay their eggs in the nest of the dominant female. Then that female—whose eggs are positioned in the center of the nest, the most well-protected spot—and her mate take care of all the eggs in that one nest. Each egg can be up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and weigh 3 pounds (1.5 kilograms)!</p>
